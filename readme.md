# (Ford Gobike Data Exploration)
## by (Michael Ghaly)


## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike System Data dataset contains information on 183,412 bike trips, including variables such as trip duration, start and end times, and user information. The data will be analyzed using Python data science and visualization libraries, with the goal of understanding patterns and relationships within the data. The findings from the exploratory analysis will then be communicated through a slide deck with polished visualizations.


## Summary of Findings

> During the analysis, it was found that trip duration is highly dependent on the age of the member, with those between 20 and 45 having the highest trip duration. Additionally, there is a trend where older ages (around 60) have a trip duration of around 3000 seconds. Furthermore, both customers and subscribers show similar trends in age and trip duration, but subscribers tend to have a higher trip duration for older ages.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In terms of presentation, key insights include the distribution of trip durations, which shows a large range of values and a peak around 600 seconds. Additionally, the distribution of user age is concentrated mainly between 20 and 40 years old.
